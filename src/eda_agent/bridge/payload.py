"""One sanitiser for the batch-payload wire format.

Lives beside the bridge because the grammar is the IPC
contract, not a detail of any one tool: tools/, design/ and
anything else that hands a payload to Pascal need the same
rules, and design/ importing from tools/ to get them would be
the wrong dependency.

Every bulk tool sends the same grammar: operations split on ``~~``,
fields on ``;``, key from value on the FIRST ``=``. That is parsed by
``NextBatchOp`` / ``GetBatchField`` in Main.pas, and the Python side
must never emit a value that reshapes it.

Kept in one place because it was not. ``library.py`` had this function
and ``generic.py`` had a near-copy that replaced ``~~`` with two spaces
instead of collapsing tilde runs, so the same input produced different
output depending on which tool sent it.

The rules are narrow on purpose:

* ``;`` becomes ``,`` -- it ends a field, so an unescaped one both
  truncates the value and turns the remainder into a live ``key=value``.
* runs of two or more ``~`` collapse to one -- ``~~`` ends an operation
  and would fabricate an extra pin or pad.
* ``=`` is left ALONE. Only the first ``=`` splits, so ``EN=1`` and
  ``OC=OUT`` parse correctly and escaping them would corrupt real names.
* a lone ``~`` is left ALONE. It is KiCad's overbar marker (``~{RESET}``)
  and mangling it renames every active-low pin on the part.

Substitution rather than escaping is forced: the deployed Pascal parser
has no escape syntax to escape TO.

    wrong.
