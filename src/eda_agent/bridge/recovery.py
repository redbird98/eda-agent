"""Guided recovery for DelphiScript engine faults (roadmap 1.2).

When the Altium script engine faults, the bridge can already tell *which*
way it failed (stuck handler vs dead polling loop vs corrupt response) from
the progress-heartbeat file. This module turns that diagnosis into concrete,
consistent recovery steps so an LLM client can relay exactly what the user
must do — instead of every call site inventing its own prose — and the
dashboard can render the same banner.

Pure data; no Altium, no bridge state. One source of truth for the recovery
copy, consumed by the bridge exceptions and the web dashboard.
