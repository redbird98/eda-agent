"""Footprint-library policy / consistency auditor (offline engine).

A PcbLib should apply the same conventions to every footprint: silkscreen on
one layer, assembly on one mechanical layer, a courtyard on every part, a
pin-1 marker, a 3D body, a consistent designator height, and so on. Drift
creeps in as a library grows across authors and years, and it is exactly the
kind of thing a machine should catch.

This module is the pure-Python analysis core. It takes a list of parsed
footprints (geometry already extracted from Altium — see the schema below)
and, for each **policy dimension**, does one of two things:

- **Inferred mode (default):** learns the library's OWN dominant convention
  by majority vote across footprints, then flags every footprint that
  deviates. This is deliberately library-agnostic — it never hard-codes
  "silk must be on Top Overlay" or "assembly is Mechanical 13", because those
  differ per house style. It reports *inconsistency*, which is the real
  defect in a mature library.
- **Explicit mode:** when a ``policy`` dict pins a dimension to a required
  value, footprints are checked against that instead of the inferred norm —
  for enforcing a documented standard.

The live bridge / tool layer supplies the footprint geometry; this module is
Altium-free and fully unit-testable. Findings are structured so a caller can
both *report* inconsistencies and drive *fixes* (each finding names the
footprint, the dimension, the expected value, and the actual value).

Footprint schema (all keys optional; richer data → more checks):
