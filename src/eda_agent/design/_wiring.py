"""Pure-Python helpers shared by executor.py and pipeline.py.

The legacy ``executor.py`` and the new canvas-based ``pipeline.py``
both need: BOM/parameter resolution, net-representation rules (port vs
wire vs label), ground-style heuristics, junction detection, and the
project-stem-namespaced sheet path. Keeping two copies risks drift.

This module is the single source of truth; both callers import from
here. The helpers are name-mangled with a leading underscore for the
legacy executor's expectations; the pipeline imports them under the
same names so a future un-mangling pass can flip both at once.
