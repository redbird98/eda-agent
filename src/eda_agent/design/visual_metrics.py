"""Perceptual placement metrics: what the rendered board SHOWS, as distinct
from the analytic objective the solver minimizes.

The analytic score (HPWL + clearance + via + ...) can rate a board fine while
a glance at the render shows a broken oscillator cluster or a tangle of
ratsnest crossings -- a proxy gap. The motivating case: a 15-part MCU board
scored ``weighted_total=17779`` with ``legal=True`` while its crystal and the
crystal's two load caps were flung to opposite edges of the board (spread 860
mils). The number called it fine; a human reading the picture saw a broken
oscillator instantly.

These metrics re-read the placement the way a person -- or a vision model --
reads the picture: how tight each keep-together cluster is, how many net lines
cross, and how the parts balance across the board. They are pure geometry on
the placement centroids (no image parsing), so they are deterministic and
cheap, and they slot into two places:

  * best-of *selection* -- co-rank candidates by ``penalty`` so the engine can
    prefer the variant that also looks right, not only the one with the lowest
    abstract score; and
  * a repair *trigger* -- ``group_excess`` flags which keep-together clusters
    are scattered so a targeted relocation pass can tighten them.

NDA scope: reads only the current placement geometry; carries no cross-project
state.
