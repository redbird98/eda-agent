"""Plan -> SchematicCanvas, pure Python.

The pipeline takes a validated DesignPlan plus an extracted symbol library
and produces a fully populated SchematicCanvas: components placed, wires
routed, junctions detected, net labels positioned, power ports placed.
Zero Altium round-trips during layout. The only Altium contact this
module makes is via the SymbolExtractor on a cache miss; everything
downstream is pure data.

The downstream AltiumEmitter (design.emitter) takes the populated canvas
and writes it to a project + sheet in one batched IPC pass.

Pipeline stages, in order:

1. Symbol extraction (once per unique (lib_path, lib_ref)).
2. Placement: compute_layout(plan) -> list[PlacedPart].
3. Canvas construction: PlacedParts + SymbolModels -> SymbolInstances.
4. Wiring per net (block-local vs cross-block):
   a. Compute world stub endpoints from canvas.pin_world().
   b. Two-pass: collect every net's stub-ends, then route each net
      treating other-net stub-ends as point obstacles.
   c. Power/ground nets get port clusters; block-local signal nets get
      wires; cross-block signal nets get labels.
5. Junction detection on the assembled wire list.

    with no wire, so it cannot be culled or short. It also clears that net's
