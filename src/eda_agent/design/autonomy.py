"""The autonomous-design loop protocol (roadmap 2.1 client packaging).

The harness has the pieces: a durable session journal, a 13-stage state
machine (``design_next_action``), background jobs, project checkpoints, but
a client needs to know the *protocol* that ties them together. This module is
the single source of that protocol, surfaced as the ``design_autonomy_guide``
tool and the ``autonomous_design`` MCP prompt so any client (Claude Code,
Codex, ...) can drive a full spec-to-board run the same way.

Pure data; no Altium. Reuses the canonical stage list + playbooks so the
guide never drifts from what the state machine actually enforces.

The layout stages (placement, routing, pours_tuning, verification) end on
MEASURED gates (``MEASURED_GATES``): each names a check, a number it
reports and the value that passes. A client logs the measured result as
``data`` on its stage_result, and ``apply_measured_gates`` reads those
numbers back, so a stage logged ``ok`` whose own numbers fail its gate is
sent back rather than taken on trust. A journal with no numbers in it is
read exactly as before.
