"""Placement orchestrator + audits + motif splat + rotation pass.

``compute_layout`` is the public entry point. It branches:

- Plans with input/output anchor roles -> Sugiyama layered placement
  (signal flow left-to-right by construction; see ``sugiyama.py``).
- Plans without anchors -> force-directed placement (constellation
  graphs without clear flow; see ``force_directed.py``).

Both paths run through a unified rotation pass, hard-shove overlap
repair, and motif splat (canonical sub-circuit layouts).

The audit helpers (``audit_overlaps``, ``audit_wire_crossings``) are
Python-side equivalents of the live Altium audit; they let tests
measure layout quality without a bridge round-trip.

The spring solver, shove, and shared placement primitives
(``PlacedPart``, sheet constants, ``_bbox_half``, ``_mass``,
``_pin_count_per_part``, ``_rotation_for_part``) live in
``force_directed.py`` and are re-exported here for compatibility
with existing callers.

    3. **Motif splat.** ``_splat_motifs`` overrides non-anchor motif
       component positions to the motif's canonical offsets. This is
       what makes a buck's FB divider render as a vertical R-R
       column even if Sugiyama placed the resistors at a slightly
       different y. Collision-aware: skips splat per motif when the
       canonical positions would collide with non-motif parts.

    Output is snapped to a 100-mil grid and clamped to the A4 sheet.
    Rotation stays at 0 (library-native).

    ``engine`` forces the placement core: ``"auto"`` (default) keeps the
    has-anchors heuristic above; ``"sugiyama"`` / ``"force_directed"`` pin it.
    The pipeline's best-of runs both and scores them, because neither wins
    everywhere -- sugiyama is cleaner on a connected signal chain, while
    force-directed (whose spring graph uses ALL nets, power included) handles a
    board whose signal graph is split by a power-only bridge (a regulator).
