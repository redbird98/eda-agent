"""Headless schematic review (roadmap V1 — hardware CI).

Runs the component-level review checks that need no netlist — the ones a
reviewer flags first — directly on a parsed ``.SchDoc``, with no Altium and
no license.

**This is an opt-in fallback, not the preferred review path.** It parses
Altium's on-disk binaries without the application, so it only sees the
netlist-free subset (missing MPN / datasheet / manufacturer, placeholder
values, designator collisions, missing designators) — it cannot compile a
netlist, run ERC, or judge connectivity. The live-Altium tools
(``design_lint_report``, ``proj_run_erc``, ``design_review_snapshot``, the
``audit_*`` family) run Altium's own engines and are always the right
choice when a session is available. The offline reader exists only for the
case where Altium genuinely can't be opened (a CI runner, a file on disk).

Because a parser reading undocumented binary framing can silently
misread a file, this surface is **disabled by default** and must be
explicitly enabled per use — see ``headless_review_enabled`` and the
``--offline`` CLI flag. Do not present it as the default way to review a
design.
