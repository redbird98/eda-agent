"""Headless readers for Altium binary design files (roadmap V1).

Parse ``.SchDoc`` / ``.PcbDoc`` directly — no running Altium, no license —
so a design review can run in CI on every commit. The readers emit the same
snapshot shapes the live DelphiScript bridge returns, so the offline review
engines consume either source unchanged.
