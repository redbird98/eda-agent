"""Visual-review rubric + loop protocol for ``design_visual_review``.

The render tools turn a design into a picture; this module turns the
picture into a *critique*. It encodes, per document kind, the things a
human reviewer looks for at a glance, and -- crucially -- pairs each
visual cue with the existing quantitative audit that measures it. Vision
finds candidates; the audits confirm and locate them. That render ->
look -> critique -> cross-check -> fix -> re-render cadence is the
error-correction loop these multimodal design agents run.

Pure data + a tiny selector; no Altium, no I/O.
