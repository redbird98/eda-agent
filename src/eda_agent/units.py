"""The unit conversion factors, defined once.

Before this module, ``0.0254`` was defined independently in six places
across two backends, under four different names, plus one inline
division. All six agreed, by luck. A physical constant stated in many
places is the same defect as any fact stated twice: nothing enforces
agreement, and the divergence, when it comes, lands as geometry that is
25.4x off in exactly one code path.

Positional literals (a part placed AT 25.4 mm) are not conversions and
do not belong here.
