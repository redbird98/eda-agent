"""Backend adapters: fill a normalized snapshot from a live EDA tool.

Each adapter turns one EDA's live API into the same :class:`DesignSnapshot`.
The neutral tools call :func:`resolve_backend` to pick the adapter matching the
active backend (or an explicit override) and then ``await backend.snapshot()``.
Adding another EDA is a matter of writing one more adapter here.
