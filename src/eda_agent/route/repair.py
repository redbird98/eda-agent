"""DRC-feedback repair planner (Phase 2d): violations in, actions out.

Pure functions, no IO. Input is the violation payload produced by the
``pcb_run_drc`` / ``pcb_get_clearance_violations`` tools::

    {"violation_count": N, "violations": [
        {"name": ..., "description": ..., "rule": ...,
         "x_mils": ..., "y_mils": ..., "layer": ...,
         "primitive1": {"detail", "type", "net", "layer",
                        "x_mils", "y_mils"},
         "primitive2": {...}},   # empty fields for 1-prim violations
        ...]}

``classify_violations`` sorts those into actionable buckets;
``plan_repairs`` turns buckets into an ordered action list using the
greedy worst-offender policy (rip the net touching the most clearance
violations first, mirroring the wire-short cull in design/pipeline.py).

Executor contract (the executor itself is NOT here -- it lives with the
MCP tool layer and applies actions via bridge calls):

- ``{"action": "rip_and_reroute", "net": N}``: delete N's routed copper
  (``pcb_delete_net`` keep_pads semantics) and route it again with the
  in-house grid router. For a
  net that was never routed this degenerates to a plain route attempt.
- ``{"action": "nudge", "net": N, "dx": dx_mils, "dy": dy_mils,
  "x_mils": x, "y_mils": y}``: translate N's offending primitive
  nearest (x, y) by (dx, dy) mils, e.g. select via location filter and
  ``obj_modify``; a local re-route of the segment is an acceptable
  stronger implementation.
- ``{"action": "widen"|"narrow", "net": N}``: set N's track width to
  the governing width rule's preferred value (``pcb_set_track_width``).
- ``{"action": "escalate", "reason": R}``: stop, surface R to the
  human. Anything after an escalate in the list is still safe to apply,
  but the board will not converge without intervention.

After applying one planner round the executor MUST re-run DRC and
re-plan from fresh violations; the planner is stateless and its
``max_rounds`` only bounds how many rip actions one plan may contain.
The executor enforces its own outer iteration bound.

All coordinates and deltas are integer mils.

       clearance violations each net touches, rip the net with the most
       (ties broken by net name, deterministic), drop its violations
       from the working set, repeat. One rip consumes one round; when
       ``max_rounds`` rounds are spent and clearance violations remain,
       an ``escalate`` action is emitted instead of more rips.

       attempt; nothing to rip).
    3. Antennas: ``rip_and_reroute`` of the stub's net.
    4. Pad/component clearance: a single conflict on a net becomes a
       ``nudge`` away from the fixed primitive; a net with several pad
       conflicts (or missing geometry) is ripped instead -- one nudge
       cannot fix multiple spots. Pad-vs-pad conflicts (no routed
       primitive) are a placement problem and escalate.
    5. Width: ``widen`` / ``narrow`` per net, direction parsed from the
       violation text (default widen).
    6. ``other`` bucket: one ``escalate`` summarizing the unknown rules.

    A net already scheduled for ``rip_and_reroute`` is never given a
    second action -- the re-route supersedes nudges and width tweaks.
