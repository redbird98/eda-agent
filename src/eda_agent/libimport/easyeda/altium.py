"""Emit an Altium install plan from a normalized EasyEDA component.

Altium's .SchLib / .PcbLib are OLE compound documents, undocumented and
not worth synthesizing. This bridge already exposes a full library
authoring API, so the emitter produces an ORDERED PLAN of existing MCP
tool calls instead of a file:

    app_set_active_document(.SchLib)
      lib_create_symbol -> lib_add_pins -> lib_add_symbol_* (body art)
    app_set_active_document(.PcbLib)
      lib_create_footprint -> lib_add_footprint_pads -> tracks/arcs/text
    app_set_active_document(.SchLib)
      lib_link_footprint

THE STEP ORDER IS LOAD BEARING. These tools are stateful: they take no
library_path and no component name, they act on the ACTIVE document and
on the component that the preceding create call made current. Executing
the steps out of order, or dropping an app_set_active_document, edits
whichever library happens to be focused. tests assert this ordering, and
also assert every step against the real registered tool signatures,
because a plan can otherwise stay perfectly self-consistent while every
argument name is wrong.

Same shape as :mod:`eda_agent.libimport.cse`: a pure offline function
returning ``{"ok": True, "steps": [{"tool": ..., "args": {...}}, ...]}``.
Driving Altium with the plan is the caller's job, which keeps this
module testable with no bridge and lets the agent review or edit the
plan before anything is written.

Units are Altium's schematic/PCB mils, and the neutral model is already
mils Y-up, so no axis flip is needed here.
