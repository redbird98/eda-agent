"""Read KiCad libraries into the neutral model the Altium emitter uses.

The part providers surface plenty of KiCad parts (a registry, and the
libraries KiCad installs locally), but this server had an EasyEDA->Altium
converter and NO KiCad->Altium path, so those hits were a dead end for an
Altium user.

Rather than write a second Altium emitter, this parses KiCad into the
SAME neutral model ``libimport.easyeda.document`` produces, so
``build_altium_plan`` works on it unchanged. The neutral frame is mils,
Y-up, origin-relative.

The three conversions that must be right, and are each easy to get
backwards:

* UNITS. KiCad is millimetres throughout; the neutral model is mils.
* Y AXIS. ``.kicad_sym`` is Y-UP (same as neutral, no flip).
  ``.kicad_mod`` is Y-DOWN, so footprint Y negates. Getting this wrong
  mirrors a footprint, which still looks plausible.
* PIN ANGLE. KiCad's pin angle points from the connection end toward
  the body, which is the same convention the neutral model uses, so it
  passes through. (EasyEDA's is 180 degrees off; that asymmetry is why
  it is stated here rather than assumed.)

    of their own: they are ``(extends "PARENT")`` and inherit the
    parent's pins and body, overriding only properties. Reading one
    without following the link yields an empty symbol, which converts
    to an Altium part with no pins.

    MULTI-UNIT PARTS. A quad gate keeps each gate in its own unit
    sub-symbol, every one drawn at the same coordinates. By default
    (``unit=None``) ALL units are read and each pin is tagged with the
    unit that owns it, which the Altium emitter turns into a real
    multi-part component via ``part_count`` / ``owner_part_id``. Pass a
    unit number to convert just that one instead.

    Never merge units into a flat symbol: they share coordinates by
    design, so a merged symbol has every unit's pins stacked on the same
    points and still looks like a part that converted.
