"""Live layout view tools: watch a board change, and say why first.

The in-house placer and router publish a snapshot of the board when a job
starts and ends, and progress while routing (``design/live.py``). These
tools open the dashboard's Layout tab on that view, log a decision before
acting on it, and publish a board by hand. None of them touches the
bridge: the view is drawn from files in the workspace.

Intended use while laying out a board:

1. ``design_live_view`` once, and give the user the URL.
2. Before each step (a block's placement, a routing order, a rule
   change), ``design_live_note`` with what is about to happen and why.
3. Run the step. ``pcb_autoplace`` and ``pcb_autoroute`` jobs publish on
   their own; ``design_live_snapshot`` publishes any other board state.
