"""EasyEDA Pro tools, reached through the editor extension.

Every tool here is a thin wrapper over one command the extension
answers, which is the same shape the KiCad tools take over their bridge.
The thinness is deliberate: the editor owns the operation, and anything
this layer computed itself would be a second opinion competing with the
tool the user is actually looking at.

FAILURE SHAPE. These follow the bridge-backed convention already in use:
a call that cannot reach the editor comes back as
``{"ok": False, "unavailable": ..., "reason": ...}`` rather than
raising, so a caller can tell "start the extension" from "the editor
refused that". ``reason`` carries the same text, because every other
refusal on this backend uses that key and a caller should not have to
know which kind of failure it is before it can read why.

MATURITY. None of these has run against a live EasyEDA Pro. They are
registered so the backend is usable and so the command contract is
checked, and every response carries ``verified_live`` from the bridge
rather than implying a working link. That flag flips when someone runs
it against the real editor, not before.

        """Work out a better arrangement of the parts on the board.

        The solver is the same one the Altium side uses and has no EDA
        dependency at all: it takes components, nets and a region, and
        returns centroids that shorten total connection length while
        keeping parts from overlapping. Only the reading and writing is
        specific to this backend.

        PROPOSES BY DEFAULT. Nothing moves unless ``apply`` is true, so
        the normal use is to look at the numbers first: hpwl_before
        against hpwl_after says whether the arrangement is actually
        better, and overlap counts say whether it is legal.

        SIZES COME FROM THE BOUNDING BOX WHERE ONE CAN BE READ. A
        measured EasyEDA component reports position, rotation, layer and
        its pads, and no box, so the box is fetched separately. Where
        that fails the extent of the PADS is used instead, and the reply
        says so through ``size_source``, because pads understate a
        footprint: silkscreen and courtyard sit outside them, and
        courtyard is what collision is really about. A placement solved
        from understated sizes packs parts too tightly, and without the
        field nothing in the answer would reveal it.

        EasyEDA positions a part by its ORIGIN and the solver works in
        CENTROIDS, so both conversions happen here.

        Args:
            designators: only move these. Everything else still holds
                its place and pulls on its nets.
            fixed: never move these. Connectors, mounting holes,
                anything mechanically constrained.
            region: ``{"x1","y1","x2","y2"}`` in mils. Taken from the
                board outline when omitted.
            iterations: solver effort.
            grid_mils: snap resolution for the result.
            clearance_mils: breathing room between parts.
            apply: move the parts. Off by default.

        For matching a bus or a differential pair to a target length: a
        meander is laid at the point you choose, sized to add roughly
        the length you asked for, and the net's length is reported
        before and after.

        OPEN LOOP AND NOT DRC CHECKED, exactly as the Altium
        counterpart is, and for the same reason: neither editor offers
        a scriptable interactive tuner, so this is the approximation
        that is available rather than the tool anyone would design. You
        pick the spot; run a DRC afterwards.

        THE LENGTH IT ADDS IS NOT THE LENGTH YOU ASK FOR. A serpentine
        adds length in whole teeth, so the result is quantised to
        2*amplitude a tooth. Both numbers are reported, requested and
        achieved, because a tuner that silently rounds is a tuner that
        quietly misses a matching window.

        DRY RUN BY DEFAULT. This draws copper on a routed board.

        Args:
            net: the net to lengthen.
            add_length: how much to add, in mils. Achieved to the
                nearest tooth.
            x, y: where the meander starts.
            layer: layer to draw on.

        The standard EMC move: tie the reference planes together
        alongside a fast signal so return current has a short path, and
        around connectors and clock sources for the same reason. A
        return path that has to go the long way round is what turns a
        working board into one that fails emissions.

        DRY RUN BY DEFAULT, like the sliver cleanup and for the same
        reason: this adds copper in bulk, and seeing where before
        committing is how a wrong rectangle gets caught while it is
        still free to fix.

        A GRIDPOINT IS SKIPPED WHEN ANYTHING NOT ON THE NET IS WITHIN
        REACH. Reach is the via radius plus the clearance, measured
        against pads, other vias and track segments. Placing a ground
        via on top of a signal is not a DRC warning to clean up later;
        it is a short, and it is invisible on a plane pour.

        Same-net objects do not block, because a ground via next to a
        ground pad is the point of the exercise.

        WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE, and it matters: copper whose layer the
        editor will not resolve is left out of the check entirely and
        counted. Vias are through-holes and hit every layer, so any
        unchecked copper is a real risk rather than a formality.

        Args:
            net: the net to stitch, e.g. "GND".
            x1, y1, x2, y2: the rectangle, in mils, any corner order.
            spacing: grid pitch. A quarter of the shortest wavelength
                of interest is the usual rule; 50 mils is a common
                default for digital work.
            diameter: via pad diameter.
            hole_diameter: drill diameter. Must be smaller.
            clearance: extra space demanded around each via.
            dry_run: report the positions without placing. On by
                default.
            max_vias: refuse rather than place more than this. A
                mistyped rectangle is how a board gets a thousand vias.

        """Offset the trailing number of schematic designators.

        delta=100 turns R5 into R105. What it is for is copying a block:
        the copy arrives with the same designators as the original, and
        moving them out of the way is what makes re-annotation possible
        without every part colliding.

        COLLISIONS ARE CHECKED BEFORE ANYTHING IS SENT. A delta that
        lands one part on another leaves two components claiming one
        designator, which the netlist then reads as one part, and it is
        the kind of error that survives to fabrication. If any target
        name is already taken by a part that is not itself moving, the
        whole operation is refused and the clashes are named.

        THE ORDER OF APPLICATION MATTERS and is handled here. Shifting
        R1 to R5 up by one has to start at R5, or R1 becomes R2 while
        the real R2 still exists. Renames go descending for a positive
        delta and ascending for a negative one, so no intermediate state
        has two parts sharing a name.

        Parts whose designator has no trailing number are left alone and
        counted, not silently skipped: a sheet of them means the delta
        did nothing and the caller should know that rather than read a
        cheerful zero.

        Args:
            delta: non-zero integer added to each designator's number.
            prefix: restrict to one letter prefix, e.g. "R". Matched

        Searches the BOARD and the SCHEMATIC and says which side each
        hit came from. A part present on one and not the other is
        usually the reason someone is looking, so reporting only the
        board would answer half the question.

        Case-insensitive substring, not a pattern. A designator search
        for "R4" finds R4, R40 and R47, which is the useful behaviour
        when the exact name is what is being looked for.

        Field names are read defensively. EasyEDA's published reference
        lists methods rather than the shape of what they return, so
        several spellings are tried and a component that carries none of
        them is counted as unreadable rather than silently skipped.

        Port of the Altium audit, checking the same slots it does:

        ``ComponentLink*URL``. A slot counts only when its value
        contains ``://``, which is what separates a real link from a
        placeholder.

        That test earns its keep here. A live schematic reported
        ``ComponentLink1URL`` as the literal string ``=HelpURL``, an
        unresolved display formula rather than an address, and a
        presence check would have called that part documented.

        Reads the SCHEMATIC, because that is where parameters live: a
        schematic tab has to be active or the editor refuses, and the
        refusal is passed through rather than reported as a clean
        board. Component classification uses the same helper as the
        Altium side, so an IC is an IC on both.

        A MEASUREMENT GAP worth knowing before trusting a run. The
        only ``sch.components`` sample captured so far is a mounting
        hole, whose parameters are unresolved templates. The same
        board's ``sch.netlist`` reports a real IC with a fully
        resolved ``ComponentLink1URL`` pointing at a manufacturer PDF.
        So it is not yet established whether ``sch.components``
        resolves parameters for ordinary parts or returns templates
        for all of them, and if it returns templates this audit will
        report documented ICs as missing. Confirming that needs one
        sample of a real IC from ``sch.components``; until then, cross

        The check a schematic review exists for. An IC whose supply pin
        has no local capacitor draws its switching current through the
        whole rail, which shows up as a board that works on the bench
        and fails intermittently, or fails emissions.

        The sibling audit ``missing_decoupling`` asks the same question
        of the BOARD, through the engine the Altium backend uses, so
        the two agree across backends. This one reads the SCHEMATIC,
        which differs in two ways that matter: it can be run before a
        board exists, and it counts capacitors against supply PINS
        rather than parts, so an IC with four supply pins and one
        capacitor is reported rather than passed.

        WHAT IS CHECKED. For each IC, every supply net it touches, and
        whether any capacitor sits on that same net with its other end
        on ground. Values are reported so the split between bulk and
        high-frequency decoupling is visible: a rail with a single 22uF
        and nothing small is a different finding from a rail with
        nothing at all.

        WHAT IS NOT CHECKED. Proximity. A schematic cannot say whether
        the capacitor is near the pin, and on a board it is the loop
        area that matters. This finds the missing capacitor, not the
        badly placed one.

        Supply and ground nets are recognised by name, since the
        netlist reports pin numbers without pin functions. Nets that
        match neither convention are listed as unrecognised so a
        non-standard rail name is visible rather than silently ignored.

        An I2C or SMBus line is driven low and released, never driven
        high. Without a resistor to the rail it stays low, the bus
        never idles, and nothing on it answers. That part is not a
        margin question: the bus does not work.

        The SIZE is arithmetic rather than opinion. UM10204 section 7.1
        derives the rise between the 0.3 and 0.7 thresholds as 0.8473
        RC, so the rise time ceiling in Table 10 fixes a maximum
        resistance: Rp(max) = tr / (0.8473 Cb). Too large and the line
        cannot return high inside the bit period; too small and the
        driver cannot pull it down, since the same section sets
        Rp(min) from the 3mA sink current the specification requires.

        Bus capacitance is the one term a schematic cannot supply: it
        is wire, pins and connectors, and it belongs to the board. So
        rather than assume a figure and report a confident verdict,
        this reports the CROSSOVER capacitance at which each fitted
        resistor stops meeting the rise time, which is a number the
        layout can be checked against. Pass bus_capacitance_pf to get
        a straight verdict once that figure is known.

        The default speed is 100kHz because it is the most forgiving,
        so anything reported at the default is a finding at every
        speed. Set bus_speed_khz to the real bus rate to tighten it.

        A ceramic capacitor loses capacitance under DC bias, and an
        X5R or X7R part run near its rating can be down to a fraction
        of its marked value. The part meets its specification and the
        circuit still misbehaves, which is why this is worth checking
        on the schematic rather than discovering on the bench.

        The default asks for twice the rail voltage. That is the
        common working rule for ceramics rather than a figure from any
        one datasheet, so it is a parameter: a tantalum or an
        electrolytic is usually derated harder, a film part less.

        WHAT IS NOT CHECKED. The actual capacitance under bias, which
        needs the manufacturer's bias curve and cannot be derived from
        a description. This flags the parts whose curve is worth
        reading, and does not pretend to have read it.

        Rails are only judged when their NAME states a voltage. A rail
        called +VBAT or +VSYS has a voltage set by the design, and

        A crystal oscillates against the capacitance the circuit

        starts, the frequency is off, and it shows up as a serial link

        audit produces confident findings about nothing.
