"""MCP Tools for Altium Designer.

Error-shape convention (two families, consistent within each):

- Bridge-backed tools (anything that round-trips Altium) report failures as
  ``{"error": "<message>", <count_field>: 0, ...}`` -- or raise, in which
  case the MCP layer surfaces the exception text. Successful payloads come
  from the Pascal handler verbatim.
- Offline calculators (``pcb_calc_*``, ``design_compute_*``, exporters)
  report ``{"ok": False, "reason": "<message>"}`` and ``{"ok": True, ...}``
  on success.

New tools should match the family they belong to rather than invent a third
shape.

# EasyEDA Pro through its extension API; "both" unions Altium and KiCad for
# the rare user who drives both EDA tools from one server.

# "both" deliberately does NOT include easyeda. It exists for the two
# desktop tools a user is likely to run side by side, and quietly widening
# it would change what an existing setting means.

#: Design tools that compute over a plan and never touch a bridge, so
#: they work on any backend.
#:
#: The design family was Altium-only because ``design_execute_plan``
#: emits Altium commands. That is still true of the executor, but it was
#: never true of the tools that BUILD and check a plan, and on EasyEDA
#: they now have somewhere to go: ``easyeda_emit_plan`` turns a plan into
#: EasyEDA calls and ``easyeda_run_plan`` runs them.
#:
#: MEASURED, not judged by name. Each was called with the Altium bridge
#: replaced by a tripwire, and only the ones that never reached it are
#: here. That mattered: ``design_preview_plan`` reads like pure
#: computation and does use the bridge, catching the failure and
#: returning a degraded result, so on a backend with no Altium it would
#: quietly answer with less than it appears to.
#:
#: A test re-runs that measurement, so this list cannot go stale by
#: someone adding a bridge call to a tool named here.
#:
#: The test only ever asks whether a NAMED tool stays offline, since it
#: iterates this list, so in principle a tool that stopped touching the
#: bridge would stay withheld. Re-measuring one is worth doing, but do
#: it against the RIGHT symbol: ``design_preview_plan`` looks offline to
#: a tripwire on ``eda_agent.bridge.get_bridge`` and is not, because
#: orchestrator._resolve_bridge imports
#: ``eda_agent.bridge.altium_bridge.get_bridge`` instead. It reaches the
#: bridge for symbol extraction, and on a backend with no Altium it
#: returns ok False with every count at zero, which is the degraded
#: answer this list exists to prevent shipping.
