"""Routing tools: the in-house Manhattan router and DRC-feedback
repair planning. No third-party routing engines.

All computation is pure Python over the board geometry dict the bridge
returns (the ``Gen_GetPcbGeometry`` shape that ``pcb_render_svg`` also
consumes). Every tool accepts its data as arguments so calls are
testable and composable; the bridge is touched ONLY when the explicit
``fetch_geometry`` flag is set. All coordinates are MILS, integers on
the wire.

Intended live sequence (the closed routing loop):

1. Fetch the board: any ``pcb_*`` getter that returns the geometry
   payload, or pass ``fetch_geometry=True`` here.
2. Route offline with ``route_plan`` (grid A*).
3. Apply the resulting ops verbatim: ``tracks`` to
   ``pcb_place_tracks``, each via to ``pcb_place_via``.
4. ``pcb_run_drc``; feed the violation payload to
   ``route_plan_repairs``.
5. Apply the repair actions in order (``rip_and_reroute`` =
   ``pcb_delete_net`` + route that net again; ``nudge`` =
   ``obj_modify`` on the offending primitive; ``widen``/``narrow`` =
   ``pcb_set_track_width``; ``escalate`` = stop and ask the user),
   then re-run DRC and repeat from step 4 until clean.

        This is the in-house engine: no Altium autorouter, no external

        the stages (two boards fewer at 100%, all DRC-clean, about 29% more
        time); plane fanout is off by default because it cost completion.
        With all four switches off this is the router before the stages,

                definitions, else read from _P/_N, +/-, DP/DM net names) as
                coupled pairs first (default True).
            plane_fanout: give every surface pad of a plane or pour net its
                dog-bone via before the signals (default False).
            pin_lanes: keep the first 0.8 mm straight out of each IC pin at
                0.65 mm pitch or finer for that pin's own net (default True).

            net_classes: Net name -> class (``power`` / ``ground`` /
                ``differential`` / ...). Sets routing order and the
                per-class track width. Unlisted nets are ``signal``.
            grid_pitch_mils: Routing grid pitch in mils (default 25).

            via_cost: A* layer-change cost in grid-pitch units.
