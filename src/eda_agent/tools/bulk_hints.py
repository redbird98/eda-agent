"""Response-time nudge that steers callers toward bulk tools.

Each singular tool that has a bulk equivalent registers every call
with ``BulkHintTracker``. If the same tool is called more than
``_THRESHOLD`` times inside ``_WINDOW_SEC`` seconds, the next response
carries a ``_hint_bulk`` field pointing at the batch variant. The
nudge fires at most once per window so repeated callers see it once
and then get out of the way.
