"""Exact-shape DRC and connectivity on a LayoutBoard.

Two questions, both answered from the board's real copper:

* **Connectivity.** Which pads of each net are joined by copper? Union-find
  over everything conductive: pads, tracks, arcs, vias, poured and solid
  regions. Two items join when they are on a common layer, carry the same
  net (or one carries none) and their shapes touch. A net whose pads fall
  into more than one group is unrouted, and the count of extra groups is
  the number of connections still missing.

* **Clearance.** Which pairs of copper on the same layer, belonging to
  different nets, sit closer than the clearance the board's rules demand?
  Distances come from ``geom``: exact, not boxed, not gridded.

It is the referee for everything the placer and router produce, so it has
to be right on a board a person finished. On a human-routed public board
it must report every net connected and next to no violations; a DRC that
flags a finished board is measuring itself.

Broad-phase is a uniform grid hash on bounding boxes, so a board with tens
of thousands of primitives is checked pair by pair only where they are
actually close.
