"""Floorplan-first placement: the blocks first, then the parts in them.

A cost-driven placer shortens wire and leaves a scatter; a person judges
a layout first by whether it is organised. So the board is planned the
way a person plans it:

1. **The fixed skeleton.** The outline and its cutouts, keepouts, pads of
   no part, and the fixed parts where they stand. A block headed by a
   fixed part (a connector, usually) is built round it there, its columns
   on the sides that face open board.
2. **Blocks as rectangles.** Each other block (``blocks``) is laid out on
   its own (``compose``), and what its parts cover plus a margin is its
   rectangle. A set of identical channels is one rectangle of identical
   tiles in a strict grid, in channel order.
3. **Rectangles in signal-flow order.** One at a time, the block most
   wired to what is already placed goes next (the connectors' blocks are
   placed first, so this runs connector, protection, conditioning,
   processing). Each time, the centres of the blocks still to place are
   solved as a quadratic over the nets the blocks share, placed blocks
   and fixed parts holding it; the next block takes the free spot nearest
   its solved centre, turned the quarter that brings its pins nearest
   what they connect to. Rectangles keep off each other, the fixed parts,
   keepouts and holes, inside the outline. On a board too crowded for
   that, the margin shrinks, then what must be free is the block's parts
   rather than its whole rectangle (``packed``), then the block is drawn
   again with its parts closer, and failing that it goes to the least
   crowded spot (``overflow``).
4. **Parts.** Each part is put where its block says. When parts collide,
   the whole block moves to the nearest spot where it fits, then each of
   its groups (the head, one side's columns), and only then single parts;
   every move is recorded with its distance, and a move over ``FLAG_AT``
   is reported as a floorplan problem rather than accepted quietly.

Positions are on a ``grid`` lattice (0.25 mm by default) through the
board origin; the legaliser's raster is a quarter of that, aligned so the
lattice points are cell centres.
