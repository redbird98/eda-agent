"""Placement: global, then legal, then refined, on the exact board.

**Global.** Wirelength as a quadratic: every net pulls its pins together
(a clique for small nets, weighted so a net's pull does not grow with its
size), fixed parts and their pins anchor the solution, and the system is
solved with sparse linear algebra, x and y apart. Left alone that piles
every part in the middle, so each round the parts are spread by
recursive bisection of the board by area (the "look-ahead" of SimPL) and
tied to their spread spots by anchors that grow stiffer every round.

**Legal.** Largest first, each part takes the free spot nearest its
global position, trying its four turns, on a raster of what is already
occupied on its side of the board: the outline, fixed parts, and parts
placed before it. What a part keeps out is its courtyard, or, when the
footprint gave only its pads' extent, its pads themselves: an edge
connector's pads can span the whole board and fence nothing between
them.

**Refined.** Parts try small moves and turns; a change stays when it
shortens the wire and the part still fits.

Parts keep the side they were on. Nets with very many pins (ground and
power, which reach every part by a plane or a pour) are left out of the
wirelength, since pulling every part towards every other is what they
would do.

That is the "analytic" strategy. The "blocks" strategy (``floorplan``)
plans the board by sub-circuit instead and uses this class for its parts,
outlines and rasters.
