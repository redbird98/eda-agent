"""Read a live Altium board into a LayoutBoard.

The Pascal side (``pcb.get_layout_model``) answers one section per call in
Altium's internal units, 10000 per mil, as integers. This module pages
through the sections and turns the reply into exact mils.

It takes a ``send`` callable rather than a bridge, so the conversion is
tested on canned replies and the same code serves any caller that can
