"""Measured checks on a LayoutBoard: the numbers a design stage ends on.

The autonomy harness closes each layout stage with an exit gate, and a
gate that reads "no overlaps" or "planes poured" is a judgement the
client makes about its own work. Each check here answers with counts
and itemised findings instead, every finding with its coordinates in
mils, so a gate can name a number and the harness can read it back:

* ``placement_audit``: bodies of parts on one side that overlap, pads of
  different nets closer than the board's clearance rule, parts on a
  keepout or a mounting hole, parts off the board;
* ``connectivity_summary``: nets routed, partly routed and not started,
  and every pad copper has not reached yet;
* ``drc``: the exact clearance check of ``drc.run_drc``;
* ``corner_audit``: track junctions that bend sharper than 45 degrees;
* ``return_via_audit``: signal vias with no ground or plane via near;
* ``plane_region_audit``: pour and plane copper that has broken into
  islands.

Nothing here measures distance or connectivity in a second way. Clearance
is ``drc.run_drc``, connectivity is ``drc.connectivity`` and shapes are
``geom``: where a check needs a question those answer only indirectly,
the board is reshaped to ask it (a pads-only copy for pad gaps, one layer
at a time with a probe pad on each piece of pour for islands) rather than
answered by new code.

    A junction is the shared end of tracks of one net on one signal
    layer. The angle between two tracks there is 180 when they run
    straight on and 135 at a 45 degree bend, both of which pass; 90 is a
    right-angle corner and anything less is acute, and those fail, as
    does any bend between 45 and 90. Where three or more tracks meet the
    junction is a branch, and a branch leaves at a right angle by
    design, so there only an acute angle fails. Footprint copper,
    keepouts, netless copper and arcs are not judged, nor is a track that
    ends on the middle of another.
