"""A routing run as a background job: board in, placeable copper out.

Pure: no bridge. The board comes from the live read (``read_altium``) or
a fixture; what comes back is the copper the router adds, in the item
shapes ``pcb_place_tracks`` and ``pcb_place_vias`` take, plus the exact
DRC's verdict on the routed board. Nothing is applied here.
