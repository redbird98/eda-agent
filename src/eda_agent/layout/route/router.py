"""A negotiated-congestion maze router over the routing grid.

Every net is routed as a tree: from its first pad, each further pad is
joined to the nearest part of the tree already laid, by a shortest path
through a window of the grid (``search``). Fixed copper is a hard wall,
cut to each net's own clearance and width by the grid's distance fields.
Other nets' routes are soft: stepping near one costs more, and more each
round (PathFinder's present-congestion factor), while every cell that was
fought over keeps a history cost. Nets still in conflict are ripped up
and rerouted until none are, so the order nets are routed in stops
deciding who gets the good channels.

What a route occupies is stamped as two exclusion fields per layer: where
another net's track centre may not go, and where another net's via centre
may not go. A stamp is the union of discs round the route's cells, made
with a Euclidean distance transform.
