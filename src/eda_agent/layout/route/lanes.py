"""Nets routed as one group of parallel lanes: buses, and pairs.

A bus, three or more nets running between the same two parts, is routed
by a person as a whole: one lane per net at a fixed pitch (width plus
clearance), nested so that no two cross, every bend 45 degrees. Routed
net by net, each takes whatever line the search finds first, and the
next has to go round it.

The group is planned the way a pair is (``diffpair``): one centreline is
searched at the width of the whole group, (n - 1) pitch plus a track, on
a single layer; each net's lane is that centreline offset by its place
in the group, so the lanes nest by construction and keep their pitch
through every turn. Out of each part the pins fan in to the lanes with
45 degree jogs, staggered where two parallel jogs would come too close.
Every lane is then checked exactly, against the copper already there and
against the others; a group that does not check out is left to the
negotiated router whole.

Copper an earlier stage laid only for convenience (a dog-bone's via) may
stand in a lane's way. Rather than detour round it, the search may cross
it at a price; what the lanes cross is taken up, the group laid, and the
dog-bones planned again round the group, and the report says which.
