"""The board rasterised for a maze router.

Each routing layer becomes a grid of cell centres. For every cell the
grid keeps the distance to the nearest fixed copper and whose it is, and
the distance to the nearest fixed copper of ANY OTHER owner. With both,
"how far is the nearest copper that is foreign to net N" is one lookup
for every N: the first distance when the nearest owner is not N, else the
second. A track centre may sit on a cell when that foreign distance is at
least the clearance to that owner plus half the track's width.

Keep-outs and the board edge have fields of their own. Mixed in with
copper they took the nearest place from copper a few hundredths of a mil
further away that needed far more clearance, and a via went in 1.6 mil
from a pad that wanted 5.

Distances are measured from cell centres to the exact shapes (``geom``),
so the only approximation is where a centre line runs between cells;
the exact DRC after routing is the judge of that.

Owners are net ids from 1, and three that belong to no net:
``NETLESS`` (copper on no net, foreign to every net); ``EDGE`` (the
board outline and cutouts) and ``KEEPOUT`` are the two separate fields.
