"""Copper pours: the board's own polygon outlines, poured after routing.

A two-layer board joins its ground mostly through pours: the designer draws
a polygon on each side and Altium pours it round whatever else is routed.
Routed as tracks instead, such a net takes room the other nets need; with
the poured nets set aside, the rest failed markedly fewer connections.

So a net with a pour outline on a routing layer is routed like any other,
and then each outline is poured on the grid: a cell is copper when every
point of its square keeps the clearance from foreign copper, keep-outs and
the board edge; necks a cell or two wide go, and so does copper touching
nothing of its own net, as Altium removes dead copper. The net's routes
the pour makes redundant are taken up, longest first, each only while its
pads stay joined without it, and the room goes to the nets still failing.
Poured again, whatever the pour then leaves apart is joined by routed
tracks and stitching vias with every other route a wall.

Set aside while the rest were routed and joined afterwards, the poured
nets got only the room left over; joined while negotiating, they chased
pour pieces another net's move had just cut off. Both did worse than
routing them as tracks. Taking up only what the pour provably joins can
only give room back.

The pour here stands in for Altium's own, for connectivity and scoring;
applied to a board, the designer's polygons are repoured in Altium.
