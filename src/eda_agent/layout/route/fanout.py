"""Fanout: the vias a board's pads get before any signal is routed.

BGA. A person routing a BGA does not route ball by ball. The outer rings
leave on the BGA's own layer, as many rings as there is room for tracks
between the balls; every ball further in gets a via first, all in one
pattern, and the routing starts from those vias on the inner layers. Left
to find its own way, the router fought over the space between the balls
for every net at once, and most of the conflicts that never settled were
round the BGA.

A via goes between four balls (a dog-bone, with a short track to it) when
one fits there, else in the ball at its exact centre, the largest style
that clears everything either way. Dog-bones point away from the middle
of the part, so each ball has its own diagonal and no two share one.

Planes and pours (``plane_fanout``). Every surface pad of a net that a
plane or a pour on another layer joins gets its via before the signals
are routed, as a person drops a via beside each ground pad first: a
dog-bone, a short track out along the pad's long axis to a via just past
its end, in another direction where that is blocked. A via never goes
into the pad itself: in a passive's pad it wicks the solder from the
joint, and an IC's pin is no better. The exceptions are an IC's exposed
pad, which takes an array of vias for its heat, and a fine-pitch BGA's
balls where no dog-bone fits; each such via is listed for the fab notes
(filled and capped). An IC's pins of the exposed pad's own net are
joined to it by a short track inward, as the land pattern intends.
