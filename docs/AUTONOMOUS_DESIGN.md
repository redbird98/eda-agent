# Autonomous design with eda-agent

How to drive a full spec-to-board run with any MCP client. The workflow is
the same everywhere; only the entry point differs by client.

## The idea

The design harness splits work three ways so client model quality affects
design *quality*, never pipeline *integrity*:

- **You (the LLM client)** make the judgment calls: requirement capture,
  part choice, repair decisions.
- **Deterministic engines** (placement, routing, value math, rule synthesis)
  do the execution.
- **A server-side state machine** owns sequencing, entry/exit gates, bounded
  retries, and durable journaling.

So you don't memorize a 13-stage workflow. You loop: ask the server what's
next, do it, log the result.

## Entry points by client

- **Claude Code**: the `/autodesign` skill (`.claude/skills/autodesign/`)
  loads the protocol automatically when the task matches.
- **Prompt-capable clients (e.g. Codex)**: invoke the `autonomous_design`
  MCP prompt, optionally with a `requirement` argument.
- **Any client**: call the `design_autonomy_guide` tool. It returns the
  loop, all 13 stages with their tools and exit gates, and the constraints,
  as structured data. This is the canonical, always-current source (it is
  generated from the same stage playbooks the state machine enforces, so it
  never drifts).

## The loop (all clients)

1. `design_get_discipline`: hard rules + the DesignPlan schema (once).
2. `design_session_start(requirement)` → keep the `session_id`.
3. `app_checkpoint("before autonomous run")` if a project will be modified.
4. Repeat `design_next_action(session_id)`:
   - `proceed` / `retry` → do the stage with its `suggested_tools`, meet the
     `exit_gate`, then `design_session_log(event="stage_result",
     stage=…, status="ok")`.
   - `blocked` → ask the user `open_question`, then
     `design_session_log(event="resolved", text=…)`.
   - `complete` → review outputs.
5. Checkpoint before `sch_to_pcb`, `routing`, `pours_tuning`.
6. Long runs → `design_job_start` + poll `design_job_status`.

## Resuming

Runs are durable. A fresh client session calls
`design_session_resume(session_id)` and continues from recorded state: the
journal is the source of truth, not the conversation.

## Constraints

Datasheet-first (cite the manufacturer PDF), NDA isolation, no third-party
routing engines or account-gated APIs, verify render-and-look, no
unverifiable safety tables. The full text lives in `design_get_discipline`.
