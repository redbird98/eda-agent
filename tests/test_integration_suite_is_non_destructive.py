"""The live-Altium tests must not modify the design they connect to.

``tests/integration/`` binds to a real Altium. Since 2026-08-05 it is
gated at collection on ``EDA_AGENT_INTEGRATION=1``, so a plain
``pytest`` no longer reaches a live session at all; see
``tests/test_integration_tests_are_opt_in.py``. This file covers the
other half, what those tests are allowed to do once someone opts in.

Every command they send reads the design: ping, get_open_documents,
get_active_document, get_focused, get_components, open, compile. Note
that ``open`` and ``compile`` do not modify the design but are not
invisible either, since they change which document has focus. That is
acceptable for a run the developer asked for, and was the reason the
collection gate was added for runs they did not.

Nothing enforced that. A single ``lib_add_pins`` or ``pcb_place_via``
added to those tests would silently start editing the board of anyone
who runs the suite with Altium up, and it would look like an ordinary
test until someone noticed their library had grown a component.

The property is worth keeping rather than just documenting: it is what
makes the live suite runnable without ceremony. Verification that has
to mutate belongs in ``docs/RELEASE_VERIFICATION.md``, where it is a
deliberate step a human takes against a session they chose, not a side
effect of running the tests.

Static check only. It reads the command strings the tests pass to
``send_command``, so a command assembled at runtime is invisible. That
direction is safe: it cannot produce a false accusation, only miss an
exotic one, and nothing in that directory builds a command dynamically.
