"""Two tools reported success for work they never checked had happened.

Both were found live, and neither was caught by any test, because a
handler that hardcodes success passes every assertion written against
its happy path.

* ``app_run_menu`` merged ``{"success": True}`` OVER the bridge reply,
  so a Pascal-side error came back as a success. It also turned an
  empty reply into a success. Underneath, Altium's ``RunProcess``
  accepts an unknown process id in silence, so the tool could not have
  known either way: MEASURED 2026-08-17, "Tools|Preferences" returned
  in 0.11s reporting success with no dialog ever shown.

* ``proj_sync_pcb`` reported success and ``in_sync`` three times in a
  row while a modal reading "Cannot compare a source document against
  its owner project" sat on screen unanswered.

The Python halves are driven here. The Pascal halves are checked by
reading the shipped source, which is the only option without a live
editor, so those tests assert the shape of the RESPONSE the handler
builds rather than the presence of a comment.
