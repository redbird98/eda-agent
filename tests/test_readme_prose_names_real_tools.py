"""Hand-written PROSE names tools that exist, not just the catalogs.

``test_readme_names_real_tools.py`` checks the README's catalog
sections. The prose was unguarded, and prose is where a tool gets
described, renamed and then quietly left behind: a reader is told to
call something that no longer exists and finds out at the tool call.
The gap was found by mutating a tool name in a paragraph and watching
every existing guard pass.

Measured before being written, because a guard nobody trusts is worse
than none: of 360 backticked tool-shaped tokens in the README, 356 are
registered tools and 4 are parameters or reply fields. That ratio is
what makes this worth having; the response-key guard measured earlier
in this project was declined at 68 percent false positives.

Covers the hand-written docs too, on the same reasoning. TOOL_REFERENCE
is excluded because it is generated, and has its own freshness guard.

Only tokens starting with a real tool-family prefix are considered, so
``save_to``, ``verified_live`` and ``violation_count`` are never
candidates, and ``pcb.components`` is excluded by carrying a dot.
