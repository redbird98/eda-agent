"""A silent bridge must say WHY it is silent, not guess.

Three different things produce identical silence: the polling loop is
gone, the handler is looping, or a modal is blocking the scripting
engine. They need opposite responses. Restarting the loop because it
looked dead throws away whatever a blocked handler was in the middle
of, and it was the standing advice: the timeout named a dead loop and
told the reader to go and check for a dialog themselves.

MEASURED 2026-08-18: a "Comparator Results" box sat unanswered while
every bridge call timed out reporting the loop was probably not
running. It was running. It was waiting for a button.

The dialog reader never touches the IPC that is stuck, so the timeout
can simply look. These tests drive the real timeout path with a bridge
whose workspace is empty, so nothing can answer and the timeout is
genuine rather than simulated.
