"""A review that read nothing must not read as a clean design.

Each backend has a one-call review that fans out to many checks and
folds the answers into a summary. That summary is the thing a reviewer
reads, and it is the one place where "I could not look" and "I looked
and it was fine" collapse into the same words if nobody is careful.

They collapsed. ``easyeda_review_board`` answered "23 audits run, 0
violations" with no editor connected, because audits_run reported the
size of the audit registry, which is a fact about the code rather than
a measurement of the board. The refusals were listed correctly further
down, so the detail was right and the headline said the opposite.

The other two were checked because of it, which is the point of writing
this once for all three: ``kicad_full_review`` reported ok:True with
every section failed, and ``design_review_snapshot`` said nothing at
all when it fetched nothing, leaving an empty list to be noticed.

The tests are shaped around the FAILURE, not the tool: each aggregator
is driven with everything underneath it broken, and the reply must not
be mistakable for a healthy design.
