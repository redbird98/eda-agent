"""The KiCad importer against the REAL installed library corpus.

Hand-written fixtures only test the cases someone thought of, and this
converter's bugs have all been in cases nobody thought of: symbols with
no geometry of their own, units drawn in two body styles, supply rails
in a shared unit. Those were found by reading the shipped libraries, not
by inventing s-expressions.

So these run the converter over whatever KiCad is installed and assert
INVARIANTS rather than specific values. Values would pin one KiCad
version; invariants hold for any of them, which is the point when the
corpus is somebody else's and changes on their schedule.

Skipped, not failed, when KiCad is absent: CI has no KiCad and these
must not make it red. That does mean they are opportunistic, so nothing
here is the only cover for a behaviour -- each has a fixture-based
sibling in test_kicad_reader.

Each corpus is walked ONCE, module-scoped, and every assertion reads the
same findings. Walking per test was three times the wall clock for
identical coverage: these files are megabytes and the parse is the whole
cost.

KNOWN BLIND SPOT of the round-trip checks below: they cannot see a
reader bug that is SYMMETRIC. Force every region onto top copper and
both passes read it that way, so the signatures agree and the round trip
is green while every fabrication layer is wrong.

Measured, not argued. Drop the Y-mirror negation from pad rotation on
BOTH the reader and the writer and run the two kinds of test:

    corpus round trip   MISSED   (both sides wrong the same way)
    absolute pad test   CAUGHT

That mutation is not academic. Altium consumes the neutral value
directly and never sees the KiCad file, so with it every rotated pad
arrives mirrored while this file stays green.

Round trips catch writer bugs and ASYMMETRIC reader bugs. Absolute
values have to be asserted against source whose right answer is known
independently, which is what test_kicad_reader does.
