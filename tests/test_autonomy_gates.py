"""The layout stages end on numbers, and the harness reads them.

Placement, routing, pours_tuning and verification used to close on prose
("no overlaps", "100% routed; DRC clean") that the client judged about its
own work. Each now names checks, numbers and the values that pass, and a
stage logged ok whose own logged numbers fail is sent back.

What must hold:

* the sentence a client reads and the numbers the harness checks are the
  same criteria, and every number named is one the audits really report;
* logged numbers that fail send the stage back, and repeated failure
  escalates to the user like any other;
* a journal with no numbers in it, which is every journal written before
  this, walks the pipeline exactly as it did.
