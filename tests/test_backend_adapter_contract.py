"""Every backend adapter must answer the same questions the same way.

The EDA-agnostic tools (`run_drc`, `run_erc`, `review_design`) dispatch
to whichever backend is active and return its answer unchanged. So the
shape of that answer is a contract stated once per backend, in three
places, with nothing connecting them.

The cost of a mismatch is not a crash. It is a tool that works on one
backend and quietly returns something the caller cannot read on
another, which is exactly how the EasyEDA snapshot came to report an
empty board: the adapter handed over a vocabulary the snapshot did not
speak, and the review found nothing rather than failing.

Adding a backend is the moment this drifts, because the new adapter is
written by reading one of the existing ones and it is easy to copy the
method names without the payload keys.
