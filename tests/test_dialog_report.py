"""Saying what is on screen, and never overstating how well it is known.

The reporting failures this guards against all happened in one live
session. A modal error sat on screen while the tool that caused it
reported no dialog. A "no differences" dialog blocked the editor while a
plan waited for an Engineering Change Order that was never coming. And
an empty message list read as "the dialog says nothing" when the dialog
was in fact displaying two lines of text that Win32 cannot see.

The last one is the subtle one and it drives most of this file. Altium
paints dialog text with Delphi TLabel, which owns no window handle:
GetWindowText, WM_GETTEXT and the MSAA tree were all measured empty on a
real dialog, so the text is recovered by OCR. OCR is a GUESS, and the
contract is that a caller can always tell which parts of a report are
exact and which are recognised.

Fixtures are shapes recorded from real Altium dialogs, so this runs in
CI with no editor and no OCR engine.
