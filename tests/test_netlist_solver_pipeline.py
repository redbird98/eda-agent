"""End-to-end validation of the geometric net solver via the design pipeline.

This closes the loop with committed fixtures only (the benchmark plans): emit
a plan through the offline pipeline, then reconstruct its netlist with the
solver and assert it matches the plan's intended connectivity. Because the
pipeline (the writer) and the solver (the reader) are independent and both
agree with the plan (a third, independent spec), a match validates all three
— including by-name / net-label connectivity on a label-heavy board (the
buck emits 9 labels), which live Altium alone could not cover here.
