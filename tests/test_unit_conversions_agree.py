"""Every mils-to-millimetre conversion in the tree must agree.

An inch is exactly 25.4 mm, so one mil is exactly 0.0254 mm. The factor
is written out in five places under three different names
(``MM_PER_MIL`` twice, ``_MIL_TO_MM``, a function-local ``MM``, and a
bare literal that ``route/repair.py`` divides by to go the other way).
They all agree today and nothing makes them keep agreeing.

A unit error is the failure this project already worries about most:
``docs/RELEASE_VERIFICATION.md`` tells the verifier that a 3D body
moving 25.4 times too far means the property wanted different units. The
same mistake in an exporter is quieter, because the file is still valid
and only the dimensions are wrong, and a footprint that is 25.4 times
too large is caught by a human or by the fab, not by a test.

This checks BEHAVIOUR rather than the constants. Comparing literals
would pass if someone kept the constant and multiplied where they meant
to divide, which is the more likely mistake: the two exporters multiply
and the DRC parser divides, using the same number.

The right fix is one shared definition instead of four. That is a
refactor across modules that do not otherwise import each other, so this
guard holds the invariant until then.
