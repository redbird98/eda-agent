"""Deciding what to press from what is on screen, and refusing to guess.

The scripted predecessor failed on live Altium twice in one session, and
both failures were the same shape: a dialog appeared that the script did
not list, so it waited for one that was never coming while the unlisted
modal blocked the editor. A longer script would only move the problem to
the next unlisted dialog, so the order now comes from the editor.

What has to be guarded is therefore not "does it press the right thing
in the right order" but the judgement:

* it never presses a button whose meaning it does not know
* it never commits a change to a design without explicit authorisation
* it answers a routine "carry on?" but never an irreversible one
* it distinguishes "nothing has appeared yet" from "nothing is left"

Every dialog shape below is recorded from real Altium.
