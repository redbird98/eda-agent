"""The release verification risk table must agree with the Pascal.

``docs/RELEASE_VERIFICATION.md`` opens with a table rating each step by
whether the Altium property it writes is already written somewhere in
shipped code. That column is the whole basis for the ranking: a property
that works elsewhere cannot be an undeclared identifier, which is the
failure that halts the polling loop and the reason the ranking exists.

The table is triage. Someone with one Altium session open reads it to
decide what to run first, so a wrong entry spends a scarce live session
on the wrong step.

This is a third kind of claim, after the numbers and the file paths that
other tests here check: a claim ABOUT CODE, asserted in prose. It went
wrong exactly once and in the direction this test now blocks. The table
said ``MoveByXY`` was written nowhere, while ``PCB_ReplicateLayout``
called it at PCB.pas:1907 and the code comment in ``Lib_Link3DModel``
said so. Prose and code disagreed with nothing forcing them to agree.

The table changes every release. That is intended: rewriting it should
mean re-verifying it, and a row this test cannot parse is a failure
rather than a skip, since silently checking nothing is the failure mode
these guards exist to prevent.

**What this cannot catch.** A step that writes several properties gets
one row each, and dropping one of them leaves the step still ranked, so
the omission passes. Closing that would mean this test holding its own
list of which properties each step writes, which is the duplication the
test exists to remove. Verified by mutation: deleting the whole row for
a step is caught, deleting one of a step's several rows is not.
