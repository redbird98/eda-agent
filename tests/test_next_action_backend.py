"""design_next_action must speak the active backend's tool names.

This is the tool an autonomous run calls on every iteration, and the
client does what the reply says. Until now nothing drove it at the tool
level on any backend, and the reply came straight out of the pure state
machine: an EasyEDA client was told its goal, its exit gate and its
suggested tools in Altium names.

The stage playbooks were adapted in ONE place, the tools list served by
design_autonomy_guide, which is what made the hole hard to see. A stage
read as fully translated while the exit gate beside it still named a
tool the client cannot call, and an exit gate is the sentence that
decides when a stage is finished.

Driven through the registered tool rather than by reading source, so a
future refactor that moves the adaptation elsewhere still passes as
long as the reply is right.
