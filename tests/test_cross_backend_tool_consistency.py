"""A tool with one name must not mean two things depending on backend.

``pcb_calc_*`` are pure physics and EDA-independent, and both backends
wrap the SAME engine functions (``design.trace_sizing``,
``design.signal_integrity``, ``design.thermal_vias``). Only the thin tool
wrappers differ, so any divergence between them is accidental.

It matters because a user or a model that learns a tool on one backend
carries that knowledge to the other. Today five shared tools diverge, in
three different ways:

* pure renames -- ``z0_ohms``/``z0``, ``dielectric_constant``/``er``
* capability gaps -- Altium's track-current tool takes ``length_mils``
  (voltage drop) while KiCad's takes ``delta_t_c`` (temperature rise);
  neither is a rename of the other
* DIFFERENT DEFAULTS for the same parameter, which is the dangerous one:
  ``pcb_calc_length_match(geometry=...)`` defaults to ``microstrip`` on
  Altium and ``stripline`` on KiCad, so the identical call returns
  different physics with nothing to warn you

This file does NOT silently bless that. It pins the known set so the
problem cannot grow: a SIXTH divergent tool, or a new divergence in a
tool listed here, fails the test. Fixing the existing five is an API
decision (rename, alias, or unify) with consequences for callers, so it
is deliberately left to the owner rather than done implicitly here.
