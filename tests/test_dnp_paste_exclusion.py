"""Suppressing stencil paste on Not-Fitted components.

This tool EDITS THE BOARD, and the edit is one a fab house acts on: a
component whose paste is wrongly stripped arrives unsoldered. So the
selection matters as much as the mechanism, and most of what is pinned
here is about which components get touched.

The detection stays in audit_variant_not_fitted; this reads that list
rather than re-deriving it, so there is one definition of Not Fitted.
