"""The autonomy guide names tools the active backend actually has.

MEASURED against a live editor: the stage playbooks were written against Altium
and name Altium tools. On the EasyEDA backend 33 of the 50 named
across 13 stages were not registered, and SIX stages named nothing
that existed there. An agent following the guide was told to call
pcb_place_components, proj_compare_sch_pcb and design_execute_plan on
a backend that has none of them: the same dead end the README explains
this project avoids when it declines to expose design_execute_plan on
EasyEDA.

The fix has two halves and this file guards both. Tools with a known
equivalent are SUBSTITUTED, and the substitute must be a tool the
backend really registers, or the guide has just renamed the dead end.
Tools with no equivalent are NAMED as absent rather than dropped,
because "there is no tool for this here" is guidance and a silently
short list is a puzzle.
