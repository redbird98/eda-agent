"""Every property the board getter answers is one obj_query accepts.

obj_query refuses a board property IsKnownPCBProperty does not list, so a
name the getter answers but the list lacks is reported as not existing.
Kind, the pour options and the body heights sat in exactly that gap: the
getter read them, the allow-list refused them. KnownPCBPropertyList is the
text the refusal shows, so it has to name them too.
