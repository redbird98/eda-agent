"""Every tool tool_guide names must exist on the backend it claims.

The guide exists because capabilities were reported absent when they
were present. A guide that sends a caller to a renamed or deleted tool
reproduces that failure with more confidence behind it, which is worse
than having no guide.

So the names are checked against the live surface per backend, not
against a list written next to them. The ``avoid`` entries are checked
too: they are the half a caller reaches for first, and an ``avoid`` that
names nothing real teaches a distinction that no longer exists.
