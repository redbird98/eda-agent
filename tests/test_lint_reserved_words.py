"""Unit tests for the reserved-keyword lint rule.

Proves the deny-list actually catches each reserved word in both the
single-line parameter form and the multi-line Var-block form. Keeps the
26-word set self-validating: if a future PR drops a keyword from
RESERVED_AS_NAME, these tests fail.

Background: DelphiScript reports "Expression expected but <Word> found"
when a reserved keyword is used as a parameter or local-variable name.
The error points at the function header, not the misuse, so it's a
costly bug to chase. The lint is the only way to catch it pre-runtime.
