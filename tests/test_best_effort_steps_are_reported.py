"""A best-effort step that fails must say so in the reply.

Two tools do something helpful before their real work and carry on if it
fails. Carrying on is right. Not mentioning it is not, because in both
cases the thing that failed is the thing the caller asked for.

``app_checkpoint(save_first=True)`` flushes dirty documents so the
snapshot includes in-editor changes. If that flush fails it still
snapshots the on-disk state, which is better than nothing, but the
checkpoint is then missing exactly the unsaved work it was taken to
protect. A checkpoint is an undo, and one that quietly holds less than
the caller believes is worse than a failure they can see.

``design_review_snapshot(force_recompile=True)`` refreshes connectivity
before reading it. If that fails the sections still return, drawn from
whatever compile state was already current. A review is then reasoning
about possibly stale netlist data while believing it is fresh, which is
the same defect this release fixed in the force_recompile flag itself,
arrived at from the other direction.

Both follow ``proj_print_all_variants``, which was fixed the same way
earlier in this release: report the OUTCOME of the best-effort step
rather than swallowing the exception.
