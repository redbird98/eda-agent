"""Every tool the README's catalog names must actually be registered.

``tests/test_readme_tool_counts.py`` checks that each ``### Name (N
tools)`` header matches the number of ``@mcp.tool`` decorators in that
section's source files. That is a COUNT, and a count cannot see a wrong
NAME: the table can advertise a tool nobody implemented and still add up.

It did. ``pcb_fillet_corners`` sat in the track-operations row with a
description of what it does, and no such tool has ever existed. The
Pascal handler ``PCB_FilletCorners`` is real and dispatched, but exposing
it was deliberately declined, and
``tests/test_bridge_handlers_reachable.py`` records why: the handler's
own header says it has not been validated against a live Altium session,
so a first-class tool would present unvalidated code as ready. Both
landed in commit 8853d93; only the README got the tool it described.

The cost of the gap is specific. The README catalog is what a user or an
agent reads to decide what to call, so an entry there is a promise. A
promise for a tool that does not exist produces a "no such tool" error
at the least convenient moment, and the reader cannot tell whether they
typed it wrong or the docs are stale.

Scoped to the FIRST COLUMN of catalog rows, which is the tool-name
column. The description column is prose and legitimately mentions
parameters (``part_count``, ``sch_only``) and net-class names that look
tool-shaped but are not, so checking every backticked token there would
be noise.
