"""``eda-agent health`` must notice a stale deployed script.

Altium compiles the copy in the install directory, not the one in this
checkout. Edit Pascal, forget ``install-scripts --force``, and Altium
keeps running the old code: a bug you just fixed reproduces exactly as
before, and the only other place the mismatch shows is ``app_ping``'s
``version_match``, which needs Altium running and the polling loop up.

So it is the one live-session problem worth catching offline. From
inside a session it costs hours to diagnose, because every symptom
points at the code you are looking at. From outside it is one file read.

``doctor`` already reports the version, but through ``_ping_altium()``,
so it cannot help before Altium is started. ``health`` is the offline
half and had four checks, none of which compared the two copies.

WARN, not FAIL. Nothing offline is affected by a stale deploy, and a
developer who has never run ``install-scripts`` is not broken, just not
set up yet, which is why that case is SKIP.
