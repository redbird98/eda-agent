"""Reading KiCad libraries into the neutral model.

This exists to close a real gap: the part providers surface plenty of
KiCad parts, but the server could only export Altium TO KiCad, never
back, so those hits were a dead end for an Altium user.

The reader parses into the SAME neutral model the EasyEDA importer
produces, so ``build_altium_plan`` is shared rather than duplicated.
That is what these tests pin, along with the three conversions that are
each easy to get backwards and easy to miss:

* millimetres to mils
* Y axis: ``.kicad_sym`` is Y-UP (no flip), ``.kicad_mod`` is Y-DOWN
  (negate). A sign error mirrors a footprint, which still looks like a
  plausible part.
* pin angle: KiCad's convention already matches the neutral model, so
  it passes through unchanged. EasyEDA's is 180 degrees off, and that
  asymmetry is exactly the sort of thing that gets "helpfully" made
  consistent by someone who has not checked.
