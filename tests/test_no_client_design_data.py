"""No absolute path into a user's own storage may reach this repository.

A path copied in from a working session names somebody's folders and
resolves on one machine only. Writing one into a comment is a single
keystroke and nothing downstream notices.

THIS GUARD NAMES NO PROJECT. A test that lists forbidden strings puts
those strings in the repository permanently and matches itself, which
is the trap the em-dash guard already documents. It matches the SHAPE
of a leak instead: an absolute path into somebody's working directory.
That is what a copied-in path looks like, and it does not depend on
knowing whose project it was.

Deliberately NOT checked here: whether a document stem like a part
number is "real". Public part numbers are legitimate in fixtures, the
corpus is already genericised, and a stem allowlist would be noise that
gets suppressed rather than fixed.
