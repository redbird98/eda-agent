"""Pin the README's per-section tool counts to the actual @mcp.tool count.

The catalog headers say things like ``### PCB (69 tools)``. When new
tools land, those counts go stale (last iteration: Library was
"22 tools" while pcb.py actually had 31, PCB was "55 tools" while
pcb.py actually had 69). The drift is silent because no one runs grep
against the README during development.

This test reads the actual @mcp.tool decorator count per file via AST
and verifies the README header matches. The mapping is explicit since
some sections cover multiple files (e.g. "Schematic and general"
spans generic.py).
